it provides an easy way to synchronize with the latest changes. If it is
inconvenient to download, or you do not want to sign up, you can use another
Git client (like [Sourcetree](https://www.atlassian.com/software/sourcetree)) or
just download a ZIP archive.

   `https://github.com/SpicyLasagne/thelastbastion`. and clone it into
   `Paradox Interactive/Hearts of Iron IV/mod`, under your user's Documents
   folder. Start the cloning process by clicking "Clone".
4. Open the new folder using a file explorer. Drag `thelastbastion.mod`
   into the `mods` folder.
