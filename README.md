# The Last Bastion
A modification for the Paradox Interactive game, "Hearts of Iron IV"

## Getting Started
**We recommend using [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) to download**;
it provides an easy way to synchronize with the latest changes. If it is
inconvenient to download, or you do not want to sign up, you can use another
Git client (like [Sourcetree](https://www.atlassian.com/software/sourcetree)) or
just download a ZIP archive.

### ...with GitHub Desktop
1. Download [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com).
2. Create a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join), and sign into GitHub
   Desktop.
3. Click File â†’ Clone Repository; in the dialog box, under URL insert
   `https://github.com/FascistThanos/TheLastBastion`. and clone it into
   `Paradox Interactive/Hearts of Iron IV/mod`, under your user's Documents
   folder. Start the cloning process by clicking "Clone".
4. Open the new folder using a file explorer. Drag `thelastbastion.mod`
   into the `mods` folder.
5. Open up `thelastbastion.mod` (the one that you just dragged into your mods folder) with your favorite text editor and go to line 10. Where you see `YOURUSERNAMEHERE` in `path="C:/Users/YOURUSERNAMEHERE/Documents/Paradox Interactive/Hearts of Iron IV/mod/TheLastBastion"`, make sure to change it to your actual Windows username. If you are not using the default location, make sure to specify the exact file location of the `TheLastBastion` folder. IMPORTANT: Make sure to follow step 4 exactly for this to work, if the `thelastbastion.mod` file is not read by the game, this will not work.
6. Start up HOI4, and select "The Last Bastion".

#### ...with another Git client

### ...without using Git
**Warning:** You may fall behind from the latest version of the mod. Make sure
to check this page often, and redownload.

2. Extract the ZIP to `Documents/Paradox Interactive/Hearts of Iron IV/mod`. Make sure to rename the folder to `TheLastBastion` (or just change the directory in step 4).

4. Open up `thelastbastion.mod` (the one that you just dragged into your mods folder) with your favorite text editor and go to line 10.
