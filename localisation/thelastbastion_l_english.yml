US_intervension_CAN:0 "American Intervention"
US_intervension_CAN_desc:0 "Ever since the United Kindgom has fallen to the external pressures of communism, the United States congress has passed a bill that allows US intervetion in the Canadian government. This means that they're influincing the people of Canada to seek more independence from the crumbling empire and it will influence the call for referendum to become independent."

#Events
 tlb.1.t:0 "Mexico has Accepted Our Offer"
 tlb.1.d:0 "The Mexican government has put out a public statement of approval of our work. In echange for economic help, we have received official approval of our influencers to enter their country. Hopefully, with this development, there will be call for govenrmental reform and democracy will be implemented. For now, we just have to wait and see how this unfolds."
 tlb.1.a:0 "This is cause for celebration!"
 tlb.2.t:0 "Mexico Declines our Offer"
 tlb.2.d:0 "We have recieved a formal response from the Mexican government. They've refused to open their borders to our influencers in exchange for economic aid. Such poor administration should be removed and replaced with some more... complacent."
 tlb.2.a:0 "We shouldn't press the matter."
 tlb.2.b:0 "Some greater action must be taken."
 tlb.3.t:0 "Urge Guatemala to Demand Belize"
 tlb.3.d:0 "In light of the falling Empire of Britain, we can encourage others to take advantage. Guatemala has a small border with the British and they would not fight a war over such a small piece of land. Such as with Canada, they should no longer hold these lands as their colonies break free and they're on the verge of civil war. If we take advantage now, this should be less of a problem later."
 tlb.3.a:0 "Send the diplomat"
 tlb.4.t:0 "The United States Urges us to Demand Belize"
 tlb.4.d:0 "A diplomat from the United States of America has informed us that they would back us in the demand of Belize from the United Kingdom. Their empire is falling apart, their colonies breaking away, and their internal politics are similar to a dumpster fire. If they were to decline, the United States of America will back our demand and threaten war if they refuse."
 tlb.4.a:0 "Send the demand"
 tlb.4.b:0 "We'd rather not risk a war"
 tlb.5.t:0 "Guatemala Demands Belize"
 tlb.5.d:0 "The Guatemalan people have fabricated a claim on British Honduras. While the land is not historically theirs, they have demanded it anyway and we have little choice but to accept. If we were to decline, the Guatemalans have the United States backing their claim. If there was a war to break our between us and the United States, the Fascists would no doubt seize the opportunity to strike."
 tlb.5.a:0 "There's not much use for the land"
 tlb.5.b:0 "A transparent bluff"
 tlb.6.t:0 "The United Kingdom Cedes Belize"
 tlb.6.d:0 "The British have weighed their options and have decided to cede Belize to us. They've realized that the crumbling of their empire cannot be stopped, and a war with the United States of America would just quicken the pace. We haven't prospected through the newly attained lands, but it seems to have a lot of potential for development."
 tlb.6.a:0 "Survey it further"
 tlb.7.t:0 "Guatemala Decides not to Demand Belize"
 tlb.7.d:0 "After the our diplomats have offered our backing in a demand of British Honduras. While it was not our choice, we have to accept it. Even in the collapse of their empire, they still strike fear in minor countries across the world. We'll have to see about this another time. Hopefully it won't cause something much worse."
 tlb.8.t:0 "The British Have Denied Us"
 tlb.8.d:0 "Despite the evidence of their falling empire, the United Kindom has denied our demands. We have two options. The United States will back us in the event of a war. The Empire could not hold against the great North American power, and we would be able to easily defeat them."
 tlb.8.a:0 "Don't press the issue"
 tlb.8.b:0 "They've made their choice"
 tlb.9.t:0 "The Guatemalan Demands have been Ignored"
 tlb.9.d:0 "The Guatemalans have sent their demands to the United Kingdom to no avail. The British, always stubborn have refused our demand and must be forced to hand over the land. Just as we promised, we will enter the war against the ailing kingdom on the side of Guatemala to achieve the removal of the empire in the western hemisphere. Unfortunately, we will have to take our diplomacy to the battlefield to determine who shall control the territory."
 tlb.9.a:0 "Their claims will be backed by America"

 #Peace Events
 usapeace.1.t:0 "The Guatemalans have Taken Their Claim"
 usapeace.1.d:0 "While we have faught valliantly, the Guatamalans with the help of the Americans have been able to take control of British Honduras. We could continue the war, it would cause mass instability withing our nation and it's been proven that we don't have the military power to compete with the Americans. The best option would be to surrender the territory and not risk any more bloodshed."
 usapeace.1.a:0 "The land was almost valueless anyway"
 usapeace.1.b:0 "We will fight to the last man"
 usapeace.2.t:0 "The British offer peace"
 usapeace.2.d:0 "We have proven that the United States is superior on the battlefield to the British. They have offered peace and have agreed to surrender the lands of Belize to the Guatemalan Government. While the land doesn't hold much value in money, it could be a very important strategic location if the communists were to stage an invasion into the homeland. There is still much to be done to secure democracy, but we've made a step towards it."
 usapeace.2.a:0 "We've done what we came to do."
 usapeace.2.b:0 "Only a total victory will suffice!"
