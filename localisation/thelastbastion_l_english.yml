 tlb.1.t:0 "Mexico has Accepted Our Offer"
 tlb.1.d:0 "The Mexican government has put out a public statement of approval of our work. In echange for economic help, we have received official approval of our influencers to enter their country. Hopefully, with this development, there will be call for govenrmental reform and democracy will be implemented. For now, we just have to wait and see how this unfolds."
 tlb.1.a:0 "This is cause for celebration!"
 tlb.2.t:0 "Mexico Declines our Offer"
 tlb.2.d:0 "We have recieved a formal response from the Mexican government. They've refused to open their borders to our influencers in exchange for economic aid. Such poor administration should be removed and replaced with some more... complacent."
 tlb.2.a:0 "We shouldn't press the matter."
 tlb.2.b:0 "Some greater action must be taken."
 tlb.3.t:0 "Urge Guatemala to Demand Belize"
 tlb.3.d:0 "In light of the falling Empire of Britain, we can encourage others to take advantage. Guatemala has a small border with the British and they would not fight a war over such a small piece of land. Such as with Canada, they should no longer hold these lands as their colonies break free and they're on the verge of civil war. If we take advantage now, this should be less of a problem later."
 tlb.3.a:0 "Send the diplomat"
 tlb.4.t:0 "The United States Urges us to Demand Belize"
 tlb.4.d:0 "A diplomat from the United States of America has informed us that they would back us in the demand of Belize from the United Kingdom. Their empire is falling apart, their colonies breaking away, and their internal politics are similar to a dumpster fire. If they were to decline, the United States of America will back our demand and threaten war if they refuse."
 tlb.4.a:0 "Send the demand"
 tlb.4.b:0 "We'd rather not risk a war"
 tlb.5.t:0 "Guatemala Demands Belize"
 tlb.5.d:0 "The Guatemalan people have fabricated a claim on British Honduras. While the land is not historically theirs, they have demanded it anyway, and we have little choice but to accept. If we were to decline, the United States may back them in their demands. If there was a war to break our between us and the United States, the Fascists would no doubt rise up."
 tlb.5.a:0 "Cede the state"
 tlb.5.b:0 "A transparent bluff"
 tlb.6.t:0 "The United Kingdom Cedes Belize"
 tlb.6.d:0 "The British have weighed their options and have decided to cede Belize to us. They've realized that the crumbling of their empire cannot be stopped, and a war with the United States of America would just quicken the pace. We haven't prospected through the newly attained lands, but it seems to have a lot of potential for development."
 tlb.6.a:0 "Survey it further"
 tlb.7.t:0 "Guatemala Decides not to Demand Belize"
 tlb.7.d:0 "After the our diplomats have offered our backing in a demand of British Honduras. While it was not our choice, we have to accept it. Even in the collapse of their empire, they still strike fear in minor countries across the world. We'll have to see about this another time. Hopefully it won't cause something much worse."
 tlb.8.t:0 "The British Have Denied Us"
 tlb.8.d:0 "Despite the evidence of their falling empire, the United Kindom has denied out demands. We have two options. The United States will back us in the event of a war. The Empire could not hold against the great North American power, and we would be able to easily defeat them."
 tlb.8.a:0 "Don't press the issue"
 tlb.8.b:0 "They've made their choice"
 tlb.9.t:0 "The Guatemalans Decide War"
 tlb.9.d:0 "The Guatemalans have sent their demands to the United Kingdom. For some reason, they still have the idea that they can win a war against us. Now we have to keep true to our promise and back the Guatemalans in their war. The United Kingdom will have to see our military power on the battlefield."
 tlb.9.a:0 "We did promise backup"

#Focuses
 TLB_The_Last_Bastion:0 "The Last Bastion"
 TLB_The_Last_Bastion_desc:0 "The many powers of this world have fallen. Our only hope is ourselves. The world, by intention or not, has betrayed us, but that does not mean we have given up on them. There's not much hope left in the world. We are The Last Bastion."
 TLB_canadian_question:0 "The Canadian Question"
 TLB_canadian_question_desc:0 "Our neighbor in the north has fallen under the overlordship of a communist nation. We need to choke the communism out of the Americas if we want to survive. We can support Canada's independence, or we can leave them to spread the influence of their overlord."
 TLB_Intervensionism_america:0 "Americas First"
 TLB_Intervensionism_america_desc:0 "While we have one ally in Asia, Japan, they must wait for our foreign aid. The Americas are our first priority. It will allow us to allocate more to Asia, and when the time comes, we'll put forth the most help we can to secure democracy anywhere we can."
 TLB_Intervensionism_asia:0 "Intervensionism in Asia"
 TLB_Intervensionism_asia_desc:0 "While the Americas are the closest to us, we need to influence Asia. Asia is the only place in the old world that hasn't fallen. The only nation that has a strong prescence in Asia is Japan, and they should be willing to cooperate. China's civil war is a crucial point in the sucess of our Asian operations, if we fail, we may not succeed."
 TLB_japanese_proposition:0 "Proposition to Japan"
 TLB_japanese_proposition_desc:0 "Japan is a nation that has great potential in Asia. With their cooperation, we could stage a great intervention in Asia. From there, we could help support democratic upheval throughout Asia and Asia minor. The high population might be difficult to persuade, but with enough effort, we may just be able to do it well."
 TLB_chinese_intervention:0 "Chinese Intervention"
 TLB_chinese_intervention_desc:0 "China has always been fractured, making this time unsuprising. Following much of Europe, they have succumb to the revolution. While underdeveloped, China could easily be exploited by the communists for their natural recources and manpower. We can stop that from happening by offering support in return for safe desinations for diplomats and influencers."
 TLB_secure_mexico:0 "Secure Mexico"
 TLB_secure_mexico_desc:0 "Our Southern border has a country that will, undoubtably, be a battle ground for the ideologies. While non-aligned, they have the potential to fall to communism. If we can secure Mexico and Canada, we should be able to secure the rest of America fairly easily."
 TLB_secure_CA:0 "Secure Central America"
 TLB_secure_CA_desc:0 "While Mexico could always be further developed, we should begin to shift our focus onto Central America. The area has many small countries, but if we offer them a union, it would be easier for them to conscript and build industry."
