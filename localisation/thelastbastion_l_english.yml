US_intervension_CAN:0 "American Intervention"
US_intervension_CAN_desc:0 "Ever since the United Kindgom has fallen to the external pressures of communism, the United States congress has passed a bill that allows US intervetion in the Canadian government. This means that they're influincing the people of Canada to seek more independence from the crumbling empire and it will influence the call for referendum to become independent."
TLB_homeland_def_agency:0 "Department of Homeland Security"
TLB_homeland_def_agency_desc:0 "The United States of America has created the Department of Homeland Security. The department's main purpose is to defend United States intelligence from other nations and organisations that seek to gain the information for themselves. The agency has defended many attacks so far and should continue to serve the country for years to come."
 TLB_expand_crypt_dep:0 "Expanded Cryptology Department"
 TLB_expand_crypt_dep_desc:0 "A critical part of keeping countries out of the hands of communism is to know the in and outs of the country and understand their politics. Funneling more funding to the cryptology department will undoubtably increase their performance and we will get more information then we have before. With our new information we can pinpoint the weak spots of foreign governments and instill instability can fill the cracks with democracy."

 tlb.1.t:0 "Mexico has Accepted Our Offer"
 tlb.1.d:0 "The Mexican government has put out a public statement of approval of our work. In echange for economic help, we have received official approval of our influencers to enter their country. Hopefully, with this development, there will be call for govenrmental reform and democracy will be implemented. For now, we just have to wait and see how this unfolds."
 tlb.1.a:0 "This is cause for celebration!"
 tlb.2.t:0 "Mexico Declines our Offer"
 tlb.2.d:0 "We have recieved a formal response from the Mexican government. They've refused to open their borders to our influencers in exchange for economic aid. Such poor administration should be removed and replaced with some more... complacent."
 tlb.2.a:0 "We shouldn't press the matter."
 tlb.2.b:0 "Some greater action must be taken."
 tlb.3.t:0 "Urge Guatemala to Demand Belize"
 tlb.3.d:0 "In light of the falling Empire of Britain, we can encourage others to take advantage. Guatemala has a small border with the British and they would not fight a war over such a small piece of land. Such as with Canada, they should no longer hold these lands as their colonies break free and they're on the verge of civil war. If we take advantage now, this should be less of a problem later."
 tlb.3.a:0 "Send the diplomat"
 tlb.4.t:0 "The United States Urges us to Demand Belize"
 tlb.4.d:0 "A diplomat from the United States of America has informed us that they would back us in the demand of Belize from the United Kingdom. Their empire is falling apart, their colonies breaking away, and their internal politics are similar to a dumpster fire. If they were to decline, the United States of America will back our demand and threaten war if they refuse."
 tlb.4.a:0 "Send the demand"
 tlb.4.b:0 "We'd rather not risk a war"
 tlb.5.t:0 "Guatemala Demands Belize"
 tlb.5.d:0 "The Guatemalan people have fabricated a claim on British Honduras. While the land is not historically theirs, they have demanded it anyway and we have little choice but to accept. If we were to decline, the Guatemalans have the United States backing their claim. If there was a war to break our between us and the United States, the Fascists would no doubt seize the opportunity to strike."
 tlb.5.a:0 "There's not much use for the land"
 tlb.5.b:0 "A transparent bluff"
 tlb.6.t:0 "The United Kingdom Cedes Belize"
 tlb.6.d:0 "The British have weighed their options and have decided to cede Belize to us. They've realized that the crumbling of their empire cannot be stopped, and a war with the United States of America would just quicken the pace. We haven't prospected through the newly attained lands, but it seems to have a lot of potential for development."
 tlb.6.a:0 "Survey it further"
 tlb.7.t:0 "Guatemala Decides not to Demand Belize"
 tlb.7.d:0 "After the our diplomats have offered our backing in a demand of British Honduras. While it was not our choice, we have to accept it. Even in the collapse of their empire, they still strike fear in minor countries across the world. We'll have to see about this another time. Hopefully it won't cause something much worse."
 tlb.8.t:0 "The British Have Denied Us"
 tlb.8.d:0 "Despite the evidence of their falling empire, the United Kindom has denied our demands. We have two options. The United States will back us in the event of a war. The Empire could not hold against the great North American power, and we would be able to easily defeat them."
 tlb.8.a:0 "Don't press the issue"
 tlb.8.b:0 "They've made their choice"
 tlb.9.t:0 "The Guatemalan Demands have been Ignored"
 tlb.9.d:0 "The Guatemalans have sent their demands to the United Kingdom to no avail. The British, always stubborn have refused our demand and must be forced to hand over the land. Just as we promised, we will enter the war against the ailing kingdom on the side of Guatemala to achieve the removal of the empire in the western hemisphere. Unfortunately, we will have to take our diplomacy to the battlefield to determine who shall control the territory."
 tlb.9.a:0 "Their claims will be backed by America"

 tlb.10.d:0 "Placeholder"

 usapeace.1.t:0 "The Guatemalans have Taken Their Claim"
 usapeace.1.d:0 "While we have faught valliantly, the Guatamalans with the help of the Americans have been able to take control of British Honduras. We could continue the war, it would cause mass instability withing our nation and it's been proven that we don't have the military power to compete with the Americans. The best option would be to surrender the territory and not risk any more bloodshed."
 usapeace.1.a:0 "The land was almost valueless anyway"
 usapeace.1.b:0 "We will fight to the last man"
 usapeace.2.t:0 "The British offer peace"
 usapeace.2.d:0 "We have proven that the United States is superior on the battlefield to the British. They have offered peace and have agreed to surrender the lands of Belize to the Guatemalan Government. While the land doesn't hold much value in money, it could be a very important strategic location if the communists were to stage an invasion into the homeland. There is still much to be done to secure democracy, but we've made a step towards it."
 usapeace.2.a:0 "We've done what we came to do."
 usapeace.2.b:0 "Only a total victory will suffice!"

 TLB_lowden_doctrine:0 "The Lowden Doctrine"
 TLB_lowden_doctrine_desc:0 "Frank Lowden, our current president is the head of freedom in the world. We believe that his doctrine may bring our country prosperity and help us to contain communism. While his ideals may seem radical and reckless, we need to have someone take the helm and steer the ship with certainty and strength. His doctrine will lead us to a better future and help us liberate countries across the globe."
 TLB_focus_containment:0 "Focus on Containment"
 TLB_focus_containment_desc:0 "While there are internal political issues present in the United States, they pale in comparison to the problems we will face in the event of a call for revolution. Much as we've seen in eastern Europe and France, we need to contain the spread of communism to avoid a domino effect that will cascade all across the world and into the Americas. Domestic issues must be put aside for the sake of the world's future."
 TLB_expand_crypt:0 "Expand the Cryptology Department"
 TLB_expand_crypt_desc:0 "A critical part of keeping countries out of the hands of communism is to know the in and outs of the country and understand their politics. Funneling more funding to the cryptology department will undoubtably increase their performance and we will get more information then we have before. With our new information we can pinpoint the weak spots of foreign governments and instill instability can fill the cracks with democracy."

 TLb_american_foothold:0 "The American Foothold"
 TLb_american_foothold_desc:0 "Panama was once in the sphere of the United States and it's economy was kickstarted by the building of the Panama Canal. Sadly, they've fallen to communism and now they may serve as a foothold for communism in America. If we do not act quickly, they could very well create a larger issue in the Central America. The best way to deal with this is to create a new regime and get the public to support to it."
 TLB_political_interventionPAN:0 "Intervene in Panaman Politics"
 TLB_political_interventionPAN_desc:0 "Panama is the only nation in the Americas that has fallen to the ideals of communism. To combat this, we have sent spies to infiltrate the Panaman government and engrain political ideas to the people and their fellow politicians. Once this is done, we can create a regime that will have support by officials and the public. Though it may lead to a civil war, we have to make a very quick regime change."
 TLB_civilwar_PAN:0 "Put the Regime in Power"
 TLB_civilwar_PAN_desc:0 "After preparations, we have sucessfully infiltrated the Panaman government and have harbored enough support to contest the government politically. The communists will not go down easily and there will likely be a civil war following the demands of the people. If a war is to break out, the American people will support the democracy both militarily and ecomomically to secure the state."
 TLB_prepare_intervention:0 "Prepare Military Intervention"
 TLB_prepare_intervention_desc:0 "Though we have already begun regime building in Panama, we have decided that our best option here is to make a military excursion into Panama. It's the quickest way to switch the government and if we decided to diplomatically pressure the standing government, we would not have had a peaceful transition in any circumstance. We'll cut our losses and prepare an invasion now."
 TLB_invade_panama:0 "Eradicate the Communism"
 TLB_invade_panama_desc:0 "The time has come for us to invade Panama. It may come at the expense of American men, but they are willing to lay down their lives in the name of freedom. Brave men of America, we call upon you to create a better world for the people of the future. Your lives will not be lost in vain and we will create a better world for your family and their future generations. We want you!"

 TLB_The_Last_Bastion_desc:0 "The many powers of this world have fallen. Our only hope is ourselves. The world, by intention or not, has betrayed us, but that does not mean we have given up on them. There's not much hope left in the world. We are The Last Bastion."
 TLB_canadian_question:0 "The Canadian Question"
 TLB_canadian_question_desc:0 "Our neighbor in the north has fallen under the overlordship of a communist nation. We need to choke the communism out of the Americas if we want to survive. We can support Canada's independence, or we can leave them to spread the influence of their overlord."
 TLB_Intervensionism_america:0 "Americas First"
 TLB_Intervensionism_america_desc:0 "While we have one ally in Asia, Japan, they must wait for our foreign aid. The Americas are our first priority. It will allow us to allocate more to Asia, and when the time comes, we'll put forth the most help we can to secure democracy anywhere we can."
 TLB_Intervensionism_asia:0 "Intervensionism in Asia"
 TLB_Intervensionism_asia_desc:0 "While the Americas are the closest to us, we need to influence Asia. Asia is the only place in the old world that hasn't fallen. The only nation that has a strong prescence in Asia is Japan, and they should be willing to cooperate. China's civil war is a crucial point in the sucess of our Asian operations, if we fail, the rest of our influence in asia could be in jeopardy."
 TLB_japanese_proposition:0 "Proposition to Japan"
 TLB_japanese_proposition_desc:0 "Japan is a nation that has great potential in Asia. With their cooperation, we could stage a great intervention in Asia.

 TLB_chinese_intervention:0 "Chinese Intervention"
 TLB_chinese_intervention_desc:0 "China has always been fractured, making this time unsuprising. Following much of Europe, they have succumb to the revolution. While underdeveloped, China could easily be exploited by the communists for their natural recources and manpower. We can stop that from happening by offering support in return for safe desinations for diplomats and influencers."
 TLB_secure_mexico:0 "Secure Mexico"
 TLB_secure_mexico_desc:0 "Our southern neighbor, Mexico, has always been a land of instability and major political influence. We need to have a secure southern border in order to create a staging ground into central America. The country has constantly been plagued by civil war and ideological battles, hopefully we can slow the process to a halt and install a stable and working democracy in Mexico."
 TLB_secure_CA:0 "Secure Central America"
 TLB_secure_CA_desc:0 "While Mexico could always be further developed, we should begin to shift our focus onto Central America. The area has many small countries, but if we offer them a union, it would be easier for them to conscript and build industry."

 TLB_aid_mexico1_desc:0 "Mexico City, the heartland of Mexico has to be a center of industry to create a strong country.

 TLB_aid_mexico3:0 "Industrialized Heartland"
 TLB_aid_mexico3_desc:0 "To create a stronger and wealthier Mexico City, we should increase the industrial power there.
