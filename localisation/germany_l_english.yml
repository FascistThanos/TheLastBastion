 tlbgermany.1.t:0 "Weimar Declares Support For The French Republic"
 tlbgermany.1.d:0 "Earlier this morning, in a public speach the Weimar President [GER.GetLeader] announced support for the French Republic, stating it is the rightful government in Paris. This will surely bolster our soldiers morale."
 tlbgermany.1.a:0 "Send them a thank-you letter immediatly!"
 tlbgermany.2.t:0 "The Weimar Situation"
 tlbgermany.2.d:0 "As the sun rises over the Reichstag, the Weimar Republic stand its ground. After defeating the Communist KPD in the 1932 general elections, the future of the German state looks promising. However, after Paul von Hindenburg died of lung cancer on 2 August 1934, the German public was shaken. His chancellor, Kurt von Schleicher, took the spot as president and tried to carry on the state affairs as usual. However, smelling blood in the water, the KPD began an aggressive propaganda campaign to gain more popularity. As the 1936 elections draw near, Schleicher’s government is afraid that the Communists are going to erase German identity and turn the German people to the filthy Reds in the East. With that said, it’s not like the Weimar Republic hasn’t had enough to deal with before the death of their president. Although slowly recovering, their economy is still weak. With the loss of the industrially capable areas of the Rhine, plus the areas of Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg to the monarchists after the 1920s Civil War, Weimar’s industry; especially their military capabilities, were restrained and lacking. Schleicher, under pressure from his military connections, mobilized the Reichswehr to protect Ostpreussen from a possible Polish annexation. Surely enough, the Poles attacked on the 7th of June, 1935. The short 2-month border skirmish led to the Weimar government to cede Ostpreussen to the Polish People’s Republic. Further weakening the already fragile republic. Schleicher ordered all unemployed men to work in military complexes or work to improve civilian infrastructure, as well as constructing a static defense line on the Polish border, hoping this will create more job opportunities and keep their economy afloat. As the sun rises over the horizon, Schleicher looks out of the Reichstag windows, hoping that he could save this battered nation. As Kaiser Wilheim II looks hungrily at Berlin in his Bavarian realm, Hitler in his Austrian office looking to unify all the Germanic peoples and achieve Lebensraum, and the KDP; led by Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht, fighting for the presidential position in the 1936 general elections, Schleicher takes a deep breath. For the German people, for the shining light of democracy, the Weimar Republic needs to survive and live on. Surrounded by all sides, the Weimar Republic continues to stand its ground. With the Reichswehr standing guard, the Weimar Republic’s future is unclear. One thing is for sure though: If the Weimar Republic is going down, it will go down swinging and fight till its bitter end."
