  #Union of Britain Events
  tlbbritain.1.t:0 "The Wilkins Debates, End of the Campbell Act"
  tlbbritain.1.desc:0 "With the tenure of the Campbell Act government coming to an end a government is needed to manage to switch from to a more permanent governmental body. Members of the CPGB are divided on whether the Pollitt administration should oversee the transition or if a parliament should be put in place as an impartial observer."
  tlbbritain.1.a:0 "The Pollitt administration is doing just fine as it is!"
  tlbbritain.1.b:0 "A parliament would be a better foundation for a more permanent government."
  tlbbritain.2.t:0 "The Wilkins Debates, Former Ministers"
  tlbbritain.2.desc:0 "There has been uncertainty on what to do with former ministers of the United Kingdom. Up until now they have been allowed to live normal lives under the surveillance of the government, but it is important to put forth a statement on the matter in preparation for the new government."
  tlbbritain.2.a:0 "They are best off as ordinary citizens, any further action would generate unrest.."
  tlbbritain.2.b:0 "These people are traitors to the state, detain them!"
  tlbbritain.2.c:0 "Their experience could come in handy, allow them into parliament."
  tlbbritain.3.t:0 "Seat of the Government"
  tlbbritain.3.desc:0 "The final matter to debate is the location of the new government. The nation is currently run from Downing Street, but many feel that it is too representative of old-Britain ideas and not appropriate for our new society. If the seat of the government is to be moved, the question is where?"
  tlbbritain.3.a:0 "Downing Street is just fine thank you!"
  tlbbritain.3.b:0 "Move the government to Glascow, Scotland, as a commemoration of James Campbell."
  tlbbritain.3.c:0 "The government should be located in Birmingham to honor the Birmingham Strike."
  tlbbritain.4.t:0 "Reformation of Parliament"
  tlbbritain.4.desc:0 "As the Wilkins Debates came to a close it became clear that a new parliament would lead the nation following the expiration of the Campbell Act. While some have expressed concerns that this parliament could emulate the greed and corruption of the old one, new ministers have been quick to dismiss these claims."
  tlbbritain.4.a:0 "To a new and improved parliament!"
  tlbbritain.5.t:0 "Congress Implicated by NSC Findings"
  tlbbritain.5.desc:0 "Shock and outrage is the general feeling amongst people today since NSC committee Chairman Oswald Moesly revealed that many members of the 13th Congress have been harboring either pro-democratic or pro-trotskyist sympathies. The government was swift to take action arresting the vast majority of the congressmen, and have increased surveillance on the rest."
  tlbbritain.5.a:0 "That den of corruption and treasonous sentiment has finally been flushed clean!"
  tlbbritain.6.t:0 "Rajani Palme Dutt Found Guilty by NSC"
  tlbbritain.6.desc:0 "A series of anti-trotskyist raids conducted by the NSC have turned up shocking evidence. It now appears that Rajani Palme Dutt, right hand man of General Secretary Pollitt has been plotting to overthrow the government with the help of Trotskyist supporters. Committee Chairman Oswald Moesly has requested the immediate arrest of Dutt without any consultation with the General Secretary. This has raised questions in the government about the committee's validity and if they might have been given too much power."
  tlbbritain.6.a:0 "Chairman Moesly has gone too far! Tell him to stop this immediately!"
  tlbbritain.6.b:0 "Who would have guessed that traitors could be found so close to the General Secretary?"
  tlbbritain.7.t:0 "Pollitt's Folly"
  tlbbritain.7.desc:0 "A series of secret raids conducted by the NSC has found that the General Secretary has been making secret contact with prominent Trotskyist figures in various areas of Britain. In light of this new evidence it seems that General Secretary Pollitt and the rest of his administration have been committing treasonous acts and must be arrested for their crimes."
  tlbbritain.7.a:0 "With Pollitt gone committee Chairman Oswald Moesly should rule this nation!"
  tlbbritain.8.t:0 "NSC Raids on Pollitt Administration Uncovered"
  tlbbritain.8.desc:0 "A whistleblower from within the NSC has revealed that they have been raiding the homes and offices of Pollitt administration officials to look for evidence that could be used to show treasonous activities and if none was found, to plant their own. He further stated that these orders came directly from NSC Chairman Oswald Moesly in what now appears to be the setup for a coup."
  tlbbritain.8.a:0 "This has gotten completely out of hand! Disband the NSC and have Chairman Moesly detained immediately!"
  tlbbritain.9.t:0 "Secret Talks CPGB Congressman"
  tlbbritain.9.desc:0 "In preparation for a Trotskyist overthrow of the Pollitt Administration some members of the Scarlet Circle have suggested that we reach out to potential allies in the Congress. However these congressmen could just as easily be spies, and reveal our plan before we can execute it."
  tlbbritain.9.a:0 "We need all the help we can get, try and bring the congressmen into the fold."
  tlbbritain.9.b:0 "It is too risky to reveal our plan to others."
  tlbbritain.10.t:0 "Trotskyists in the Union of Britain Request Aid"
  tlbbritain.10.desc:0 "We have received a message that Trotskyists are planning a coup in the Union of Britain. They have reached out to us to ask for supplies and support for the new government. The question is if we have anything to spare."
  tlbbritain.10.a:0 "We can always assist our comrades."
  tlbbritain.10.b:0 "Inform them that we are currently stretched too thin to offer our support."
  tlbbritain.11.t:0 "[FROM.getname] Agrees to Support Coup"
  tlbbritain.11.desc:0 "We have received word that [FROM.getname] has agreed to support us in the event of a coup."
  tlbbritain.11.a:0 "Excellent."
  tlbbritain.12.t:0 "Countercoup"
  tlbbritain.12.desc:0 "After months of preparation the time has come to overthrow the Pollitt administration and bring the world revolution to Britain! Members of the coup have been armed and are prepared to arrest all senior government officials. Whether or not this goes smoothly could mean the difference between a successful coup and a civil war."
  tlbbritain.12.a:0 "Let us hope for the best."
  tlbbritain.13.t:0 "Pollitt Evades Arrest"
  tlbbritain.13.desc:0 "Somehow Harry Pollitt has evaded members of the coup and fled into the countryside. Our worst fears manifested when he called upon his supporters and the military to stand their ground and stop all those who seek to undermine Britain's security and values."
  tlbbritain.13.a:0 "It appears we must do the same."
  tlbbritain.14.t:0 "End of the Civil War"
  tlbbritain.14.desc:0 "After extended fighting the civil war has come to an end. While some small pockets of resistance remain, the core of Pollitt's forces have been defeated. With control of the nation firmly in our hands we can now lead Britain as a Trotskyist nation. However, the civil war has devastated much of our industry and now we must turn to reconstruction and healing the wounds that it caused."
  tlbbritain.14.a:0 "The British people will soldier on."
  tlbbritain.15.t:0 "Countercoup Successful"
  tlbbritain.15.desc:0 "Everything went according to plan and Harry Pollitt along with other senior government officials have been detained. With Pollitt's corrupt and ideologically abhorrent administration toppled we can now lead Britain as a Trotskyist nation."
  tlbbritain.15.a:0 "The revolution has successfully been spread to Britain!"
  tlbbritain.16.t:0 "First Session"
  tlbbritain.16.desc:0 "Today marks a momentous moment in British history as the new parliament meets for its first session. Support is divided amongst totalists, Trotskyists, and social democrats. It appears that the social democrats have won the majority, but the parliament has yet to decide upon a prime minister. The new prime minister could unite or increasingly divide the new parliament, so it will be important to elect the right person for the job."
  tlbbritain.16.a:0 "Ernest Bevin, a prominent trade union representative, is the best man for the job."
  tlbbritain.16.b:0 "Hugh Dalton, despite rumored exile sympathies, is the ideal candidate."
  tlbbritain.17.t:0 "Demoratic Ministers Appeal to Hugh Dalton"
  tlbbritain.17.desc:0 "Following the recent election of Hugh Dalton as prime minister rumors have continued to swirl that he has exile sympathies. Intrigued by these rumors some of the ministers that were members of the former government have approached Hugh Dalton with an offer. They suggest that Britain would be better off reuniting with the exiles, and Dalton is the only man that can make it happen."
  tlbbritain.17.a:0 "How dare they! They are traitors and need to be punished!"
  tlbbritain.17.b:0 "An interesting proposition, perhaps Britain will be united once more."
  tlbbritain.18.t:0 "Union of Britain Requests Reconciliation"
  tlbbritain.18.desc:0 "Members of the government were surprised when they were informed that the illegitimate British government in England wanted to reunite our nations. While it is clear that communism has no place in Britain, it appears that the Union of Britain has begun to shift back towards democracy. By rejoining them we would have a chance to ensure that shift succeeds without bloodshed."
  tlbbritain.18.a:0 "Tell them we wish to reunify, and will prepare for our peaceful return."
  tlbbritain.18.b:0 "We desire reunification, but they must agree to re-adopt some of the government's old characteristics."
  tlbbritain.18.c:0 "Negotiating with communists is tantamount to being communists ourselves, tell them we refuse!"
  tlbbritain.19.t:0 "British Government in Exile Agrees to Reunify"
  tlbbritain.19.desc:0 "Today a special session was held in parliament to celebrate the reunification of Britain. The false government in Canada has agreed to return and reunite with our new government in Britain, meaning that we have achieved lasting peace without the need for yet another war."
  tlbbritain.19.a:0 "A testament to the virtues of democracy!"
  tlbbritain.20.t:0 "British Government in Exile Seeks Reunification in Exchange for Compromises"
  tlbbritain.20.desc:0 "Today a special session was held in parliament to the demands that the British Government in Exile stipulated were a necessity for reunification. They stated that for the two governments to merge that first and foremost we must denounce the actions taken under the Campbell Act and pay reparations to businesses that lost profits as a result of the new government. While these demands might run contrary to some of our core beliefs many argue that they are worth accepting for the chance to reunify peacefully."
  tlbbritain.20.a:0 "Accept the demands, we must reunify peacefully at all costs."
  tlbbritain.20.b:0 "The price for reunification is too steep, decline the offer."
  tlbbritain.21.t:0 "Union of Britain Accepts Demands"
  tlbbritain.21.desc:0 "The Union of Britain has agreed to our demands in exchange for the reunification of our two governments. This marks a momentous occasion and a chance to celebrate the total war that was avoided by this decision."
  tlbbritain.21.a:0 "It seems we will be returning home sooner than expected."
  tlbbritain.22.t:0 "Union of Britain Declines Demands"
  tlbbritain.22.desc:0 "It appears the Union of Britain, unwilling to compromise their socialist ideology, has declined our offer for reunification. It is now clear that the only way we will return to Britain is through total war."
  tlbbritain.22.a:0 "Rally the troops!"
  tlbbritain.23.t:0 "Parliament Moves to Disband the General Union"
  tlbbritain.23.desc:0 "Outrage today as parliament introduced a bill that would disband the General Union. The General Union has functioned as the legislature and voice of the various worker's unions throughout Britain, and was viewed as a shining beacon of the idea of giving power to the working man. However, many in parliament believe that the General Union is blocking attempts to achieve true socialism by keeping any significant changes from being made to the economy. Whether or not the bill passes will be determined by how devoted parliament is to the socialist cause."
  tlbbritain.23.a:0 "The General Union must go!"
  tlbbritain.23.b:0 "We can't take such an important thing away from the workers, have the prime minister veto the bill."
  tlbbritain.24.t:0 "Fate of the Royal Family"
  tlbbritain.24.desc:0 "With the recent reunification of Britain there have been questions as to whether or not the monarchy should be put back in place. They presumptive king, Edward VIII and his family remained in Canada when the Exiles returned to Britain, and are now waiting anxiously for whether or not they will be allowed to return to their old kingdom."
  tlbbritain.24.a:0 "The monarchy has always been a core part of British tradition, allow them to return."
  tlbbritain.24.b:0 "Allow them all to return except Edward VIII, as he spoke out in favor of the soldiers at the Birmingham march, George VI will be the new king."
  tlbbritain.24.c:0 "Let them return, but make Elizabeth II the queen as she can be molded to support the new socialist Britain."
  tlbbritain.24.d:0 "If they wish to return they can do so as common folk."
  tlbbritain.25.t:0 "Second Session"
  tlbbritain.25.desc:0 "Today parliament met for its second major session since its establishment. The Union of Britain has changed a lot since then, and has become the beacon of democratic socialism it was always meant to be. While the first meeting of this session is largely ceremonial, there was a debate over whether or not there should be a holiday celebrating the commemoration of the new parliament. While many ministers support this idea some say that such a day would be little more than self-indulgence."
  tlbbritain.25.a:0 "An excellent idea! Let the day this parliament was established henceforth be known as Parliament Day!"
  tlbbritain.25.b:0 "A holiday would be nothing more than self-admiration, if people wish to celebrate this day then they may do so of their own accord."
  tlbbritain.26.t:0 "An early return?"
  tlbbritain.26.desc:0 "A call was received today directly from the Union of Britain's prime minister. He revealed that he and other members of his government wish to return Britain to the nation is once was, and would like to know how soon we would be able to assist in such a scheme."
  tlbbritain.26.a:0 "We are at their beck and call, just tell us when."
  tlbbritain.26.b:0 "We require additional time, give us six months and we shall be ready."
  tlbbritain.26.c:0 "One year from now we will be ready for our return."
  tlbbritain.27.t:0 "British Government in Exile Ready to Return"
  tlbbritain.27.desc:0 "Having debated our plan, the British Government in Exile informed us that they are ready to return whenever we so choose."
  tlbbritain.27.a:0 "Excellent."
  tlbbritain.28.t:0 "British Government in Exile Ready to Return in Six Months"
  tlbbritain.28.desc:0 "Having debated our plan, the British Government in Exile informed us that they are not yet ready to return, and require about six months time to prepare."
  tlbbritain.28.a:0 "So be it."

  tlbbritain.29.desc:0 "Having debated our plan, the British Government in Exile informed us that they are not yet ready to return, and require about a year's time to prepare."

  tlbbritain.30.t:0 "Operation Sunset"
  tlbbritain.30.desc:0 "For the sun to rise in one part of the world it must set in another. Well today the sun is setting over the Union of Britain and rising over the British Empire of old. Earlier today democratic loyalists in the army seized various portions of Britain under the command of Prime Minister Dalton. Soon after senior government officials in the British Government in Exile announced that they would be joining the Prime Minister's side, and that he was the rightful leader of the United Kingdom. However, upon hearing this former General Secretary Henry Pollitt declared that Prime Minister Dalton was a traitor and rallied the remainder of the army to his control. It now appears as though the Union of Britain is embroiled in a state of civil war."
  tlbbritain.30.a:0 "For king and country!"
  tlbbritain.31.t:0 "End of the British Civil War"
  tlbbritain.31.desc:0 "After a period of heavy fighting Henry Pollit's forces have finally been defeated. While they put up a strong fight they were no match for the combined forces of democratic army loyalists, Exile divisions, and reinforcements from throughout the British Empire. It appears that Britain's transition to communism has come to an abrupt and bloody end, and that the United Kingdom has been restored."
  tlbbritain.31.a:0 "With the war won, we must now direct our efforts towards reconstruction."
  tlbbritain.32.t:0 "Death of a Hero"
  tlbbritain.33.desc:0 "The nation of Britain has gone into mourning today after it was discovered that the wildly popular businessman Robert E. O. Speedwagon was found dead in his London home. Having risen to prominence throughout the 20th century as an oil tycoon who used his immense wealth for the common good, the nation will never forget all the good that he did for this nation. His name lives on posthumously in the charity he founded know as the Speedwagon Foundation, which is responsible for over 100000 pounds in charity work annually."
  tlbbritain.33.a:0 "He shall be remembered as one of the greatest men Britain has ever known!"
  tlbbritain.34.t:0 "Campbell Act Extended"
  tlbbritain.34.desc:0 "As the Wilkins Debates came to a close it became clear that the Pollitt government was going to stay in power. Earlier this morning they passed a measure extending the Campbell Act and the length of the provisional government indefinitely."

  tlbbritain.36.t:0 "Ministers Demand Compensation"
  tlbbritain.36.desc:0 "Following the success of the recent countercoup, the ministers that assisted us are demanding a form of compensation. The ability to live in a Trotskyist society should be reward enough, but if we don't compensate them we will have to take care of them through other methods."
  tlbbritain.36.a:0 "Give them what they demand."
  tlbbritain.36.b:0 "Ungrateful bastards, execute them for treason!"
