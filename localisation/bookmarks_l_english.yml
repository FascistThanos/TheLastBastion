 GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Dark times are coming. In Europe, Hitler has consolidated his power and his attention is now increasingly drawn beyond Germany's borders. Mussolini's Italy continues to embark on daring military adventures, while the Empire of Japan stands poised to attack China in Asia. Almost twenty years have passed since the end of the Great War, and the world has yet again been doused in gasoline. A single spark may be all it takes."

 HITTING_FAN_DESC:0 "Yup, that's right! That umbrella collection is about to come in real handy."
 FRA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "France is facing a difficult situation. Led by Daladier, the war has been a long one. Ever since the Communists rose up, the French people have been questioning their leadership. The Communists in the North occupy Paris, and proclaim they are the rightful French state, while we fight desperately on the front lines to regain control. The northerners mock us for our feeble attempts at retaking our homeland, while we fight for our freedom. This is our last stand, for France, for Freedom, for Democracy. \n\nLongue vie à la France!"
 GER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Germany is divided. Led by Kaas, the Weimar Republic has not fallen, yet. Following the Great War, the German Empire was divided up by the Entente into four regions, with the Weimar Republic being the main remnant, maintaining the North as well as the Kaiser. The Treaty of Versailles placed a heavy burden on the Weimar’s government and people, with its heavy economic burden as well as taking core german territories in Baden-Wurttemberg, Bavaria, and the Rhine. The other Germanic States are not legitimate in the eyes of Weimar, and Kaas’ advisors tell him to take them over while France and England are looking the other way. The economy is in shambles following the Great War, and rapidly inflating into an economic recession."
 ITA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Italy has united. Led by Parri, the Second Italian Republic has found itself in a hole. The Communists threaten to take control of the Republic, and oust the King as well as the Senate. Meanwhile, Mussolini is set to be released in 3 years, and his PNF supporters are getting ready and arming themselves. The French Civil War has been sending refugees into our side of Savoy, and the cities in the region are becoming overburdened. King Emmanuel has taken to alcohol, and no longer cares for the country as the PCI and PNF plot to overthrow the government and each other. \n\nSiamo la Nuova Roma!"
 SOV_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Soviet Union has risen. Led by Trotsky, His Lordship has reigned supreme over the traitorous Ioseb Jughashvili. Now leading the reigns over most of Eastern Europe, the Union has grown strong. Trotsky, with his vast power has sprung revolutions across the Old World to spread the global revolution. However, His Lordship has contenders to his power, and his leadership is not guaranteed. The Industrialization Program has not done as well as was hoped, and the workers are becoming restless. \n\nDa Zdravstvuyet Yego Svetlost'!"

 SPR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Spain is in a mess. Led by Azana, the Spanish Republic has seen many threats against its existence. Nationalist movements across the Pyrnees has caused a build up of troops in the region, and there have been numeral fatalities in riots. The generals threaten to overthrow the government and bring in the Junta, while the communists demand change in Valencia, and the Carlists want the rightful King back in the South. Azana has limited control over the First Spanish Republic, and his political enemies constantly try to wrestle that control away from him into their hands. \n¡La República nunca caerá!"
 CHI_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "China is in turmoil. Led by Kai-Shek, the Republic of China is embroiled in Civil War. Brutal guerrilla fighting has been occurring all along the front line against Mao’s wave of men. Kai-Shek can barely hold his nation together with the threat of a general’s revolt if he eyes away. Meanwhile, Mao has free reign to raid the Republic’s villages and burn them to the ground. The Japanese still eye the Republic, remembering their former colonial empire. \n\nGònghéguó yongyuan bù huì lúnxiàn!"

With a ruthless enemy in the south and potential enemies everywhere; a titanic struggle is needed to spread the enlightened ideas of the Chinese Workers to Asia! \n\nMáozédōng wànsuì!"

 OTHER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The nations of the world, great and small, are not all content to hold their breath awaiting the outbreak of another global conflict. From major powers on the brink of civil war to the many nations formed and transformed by the Great War, all will have to make difficult decisions and balance ideals with pragmatism to have an impact on the future of the world."
